# IBAN Checker

**IBAN Checker** is a microservices-based application designed to validate International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs). It leverages a modern technology stack, integrating a **React.js** frontend, **Spring Boot** backend services, **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage, **Redis** for caching, and a robust observability setup with **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **Tempo**.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline: from handling user input on the frontend to validating IBANs on the backend and visualizing metrics, logs, and traces in a unified observability dashboard.

## Overview

The IBAN Checker system is composed of multiple microservices behind an Nginx reverse proxy. Users interact with a React.js frontend that communicates with backend Spring Boot services. Requests flow through Nginx to a set of Spring Boot microservices that validate IBANs. Data is stored in PostgreSQL and frequently accessed results are cached in Redis to reduce latency. The entire systemâ€™s health, performance, logs, and traces are monitored and visualized with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Tempo.

### System Design

Below is a high-level architecture diagram showing the interaction between different components:

### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram illustrates the request flow from the user (frontend) to the backend microservices through Nginx, and how the IBAN validation logic is processed:

## Architecture & Components

### Frontend (React.js)

- **Key Features:**
  - Provides a user interface to enter and validate IBANs.
  - Displays results (valid/invalid) and interactive forms.
  - Communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

### Backend (Spring Boot)

- **Key Features:**
  - Multiple Spring Boot services (e.g., `ibanapi-a`, `ibanapi-b`, `ibanapi-c`) handle IBAN validation logic.
  - Includes Spring Boot Actuator endpoints for health checks and metrics.
  - Implements OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing.

### Database (PostgreSQL)

- **Key Features:**
  - Stores bank details based on the bank identifier.

### Caching (Redis)

- **Key Features:**
  - Caches validated IBAN results to improve

### Load Balancing & Reverse Proxy (Nginx)

- **Key Features:**
  - Acts as a reverse proxy to route incoming requests to the appropriate Spring Boot microservice.
  - Improves system scalability.

### Observability Stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo)

- **Prometheus:** Collects metrics from services and system components.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes metrics, logs, and traces; provides dashboards and alerting.
- **Loki:** Centralized logging solution for aggregating logs from all services.
- **Tempo:** Provides distributed tracing, allowing you to track requests across service boundaries.

### Prerequisites (Optional)

- **Docker & Docker Compose:**  
  Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.
- **k6 (optional):**  
  For load testing, install [k6](https://k6.io/).

### Setup Instructions (Optional)

1. **Install Docker:**  
   Refer to the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation steps.

2. **Install Docker Compose:**  
   Refer to the [Docker Compose website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation steps.

3. **Install Loki Docker Driver:**

   ```bash
   sudo docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:2.9.2 --alias loki --grant-all-permissions
   ```

4. Start all services with docker-compose

   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Load Testing

5. Send requests with **curl** to the Nginx to Spring Boot REST API

   ```bash
   bash request-script.sh
   ```

6. Load test with 100 virtual users for a 60 seconds session using [k6](https://k6.io/):

   a. Install k6

   Follow the instructions on the [k6 website](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) to install k6 for your operating system.

   b. Run the load test

   ```bash
   k6 run --vus 100 --duration 60s load_test.js
   ```

   Or send requests manually from applications' Swagger UI:

   - nginx: [http://localhost:80/docs](http://localhost:80/docs)
   - ibanapi-a: [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)

   sudo docker-compose down
   ```

## Demo Frontend

### Start page

The application homepage provides an interface for entering and validating IBANs.

![alt frontend](docs/imgs/frontend-1.png)

### Enter Valid IBAN

When a valid IBAN is entered, the application displays a success message with the bank details.

### Enter Invalid IBAN

When an invalid IBAN is entered, the application displays an not valid message with the reasons.
